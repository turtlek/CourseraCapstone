The benefits of being a traveling nurse can be\n<br> higher pay and the ability to travel around the country exploring cities. Challenges with this traveling profession are identification of cities that meet \n<br> your interests and professional needs. Since short term housing is usually available in most cities, this tool will help prospective travelling nurses \n<br>identify hospital neighborhoods with appealing venues within a radius of the hospital. \n<p>This data science project will explore integration of hospital rating data available from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid services with Foursquare venue data. \n    <br> The analysis will be performed just for hospitals in the five boroughs of New York City. In addition, the Foursquare data will be optimized to provide sights\n    <br> relating arts and outdoor activities over restaurants. The results will provide neighborhood clusters centered around the hospitals in New York and show \n    <br> the top venues for each neighborhood. This data will be displayed on a map and help the prospective nurses better select their desirable hospital neighborhoods. \n"
